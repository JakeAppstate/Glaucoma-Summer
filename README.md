This is a continuation of my thesis in order to imporve the results. This is mainly done by porting the code from Tensorflow to Pytorch.

To run the code:
1. Download the dataset
2. Install Pytorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Numpy, OpenCV, and Pandas
3. Change hyperparamaters and filepaths to be consistant with your machine.
4. Set Weights and Biases environmental variables before running
5. Run main.py from root folder
